GETTING STARTED

I started off with the idea of having a app where you can easily have accesss to hair/makeup products that are all compatible to your specific skin type and needs. Where you can create a profile that will save info like your hair texture, skin tone, allergies, etc. and when you go to search up let's say - foundation - it will autofilter the results for you and show you only the foundations that will match your skin tone or give you the right amount of moisture that you would need.

After pitching the idea, I realized that this might be too ambitious for MVPs so I a toned it down a notch.

I shouldn't have came up with an idea for my app until I thoroughly looked at the API's and what info was provided. The Makeup API also didn't provide which products were great for dry/oily skin, nor did it provide products for hair or even lotions. So now i'm a bit more limited to what my app can do.

MVPS
I am aiming to have an app where users can log on and browse beauty products and save it into their "vanity" for when they decide they're ready to buy or for when they are ready to re-buy products.
There should be ease to sign up and make an account, and then be able to see what has been saved and also the option to be redirected to a page where the user can purchase the products as well.

STRETCH GOALS
I would love to add the ability for users to review products and have a comment section. And also maybe try to attempt to give users the option to filter through products by allergies, color, and more.

ROAD BLOCKS
2/25 - I'm finally ready to make an API call and there's a probem with AWS. My Makeup API is using herokuapp and may not be ready to pay for my usage soooooooo, I'm now prepared to populate a database and just use the info in there.
